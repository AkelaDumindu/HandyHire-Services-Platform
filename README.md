## Project Description

HandyHire is a comprehensive web application built to bridge the gap between users seeking professional services and skilled service providers. The primary aim of this platform is to create a centralized system where users can search for and hire service providers based on various categories. Users can log in securely using their authentication details, explore different service providers, and select the one that best suits their needs. After hiring a service provider, users can leave reviews to help others make informed decisions.

The platform also empowers administrators to manage the service providers, including adding new providers and organizing them into appropriate categories. Reviews and ratings play a significant role in showcasing the quality of services, helping users make better choices. HandyHire aims to offer future functionalities like tracking service providers based on their locations (districts) to enhance accessibility and convenience.

The application leverages a robust technology stack, including Angular for the front-end development, Spring Boot for the back-end APIs, and MySQL for database management. Together, these technologies ensure a reliable, scalable, and efficient platform.
